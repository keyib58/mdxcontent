For a time, Penguin Panic has been an extraordinary part of the KingMidas Games journey, offering a fun twist on the classic minesweeper-style gameplay. After an incredible run, KingMidas Games will officially retire the game from all active markets.

Penguin Panic first made its debut at SiGMA Americas São Paulo, instantly capturing attention with its adorable graphics, instant win features, and social aspects. Originally inspired by the tabletop game 'Save The Penguin’, its straightforward gameplay and attractive payouts delivered endless fun and excitement.

Penguin Panic has played a pivotal role in shaping our creative direction, providing the team with critical insights that now fuel bolder aspirations and have set the foundation for more engaging, immersive, and unique playing experiences.
