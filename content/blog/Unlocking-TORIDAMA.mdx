The Global Rise of Japanese IPs

There is something undeniably magnetic about Japanese pop culture, from its offbeat humour to its iconic character design and fast-paced entertainment formats. In recent years, we have seen Japanese intellectual properties (IPs) rise rapidly in global gaming, anime, and collectibles. Now, they are starting to make waves in the iGaming space.


One standout title is TORIDAMA 2, originally released on Nintendo Switch and PC by G‑MODE. Known in full as TORIDAMA 2: Brave Challenge, the game features 25 quirky and intense mini-games that test players’ courage and reflexes in increasingly absurd and high-stakes scenarios: from stalling cars at the edge of a cliff to dodging falling objects at the last second. With its bold humour, eccentric challenges, and fast-paced gameplay, TORIDAMA 2 instantly became a cult favourite in Japan and beyond.
